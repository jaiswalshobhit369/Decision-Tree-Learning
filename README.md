# Decision Tree Learning
The Decision Tree Learning algorithm adopts a greedy divide-and-conquer strategy: always test the most important attribute first. This test divides the problem up into smaller subproblems that can then be solved recursively. By “most important attribute,” we mean the one that makes the most difference to the classification of an example. That way, we hope to get to the correct classification with a small number of tests, meaning that all paths in the tree will be short and the tree as a whole will be shallow.

On some problems, the Decision Tree Learning algorithm will generate a large tree when there is actually no pattern to be found. This problem is called overfitting. A technique called decision tree pruning combats overfitting. Pruning works by eliminating nodes that are not clearly relevant. We start with a full tree, as generated by Decision Tree Learning. We then look at a test node that has only leaf nodes as descendants. If the test appears to be irrelevant detecting only noise in the data then we eliminate the test, replacing it with a leaf node. We repeat this process, considering each test with only leaf descendants, until each one has either been pruned or accepted as is. In this project we use chi-square to test irrelevance of attribute

## Usage
`python decision.py file_name alpha`

**file_name** contains tagged data

**alpha** is used for chi-square pruning
